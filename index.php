                        <p class="flow-text ">Every scholarship window, the Chinese Embassy in Botswana receives a large
                            number of
                            scholarship applications but they can only select between 40-60 meaning a lot of very good and
                            academic excellent
                            students miss out on receiving fully funded scholarship. Some miss out only because they failed
                            to sell themselves well enough to
                            make the cut. Now the difference with us is, even if we
                            receive 40000 applications we are going to process them all to give everyone a chance.All our
                            team members at some point won
                            a fully funded scholarship from different organizations therefore we all know the do's and
                            dont's of writing scholarship winning proposals and essays.
                            So rest assured, we will revamp, polish and fine tune every application to portray each
                            individual like the magnificent academic gurus they all are.
